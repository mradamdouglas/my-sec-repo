### Geography 

I live somewhere on Earth, in a place where I can see many natural rock formations.... Mind your
business about exactly where. 

### Reading

Three of my favorite books are: 
- *Between the World and Me* by Ta-Nehisi Coates
- *Illusions: The Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah* by Richard Bach
- *Survival Math* by Mitchell S Jackson

### Coding

My favorite languages are 
1. COBOL
2. JCL
3. C#
4. Java

You can get the GnuCOBOL compiler at [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnucobol).
