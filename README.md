### Geography 

I live somewhere on Earth, in a place where I can see many natural rock formations.... Mind your
business about exactly where.

Three of my favorite books are: 
- *Between the World and Me* by Ta-Nehisi Coates

### Coding

#### My favorite languages are 
1. COBOL
2. JCL
3. C#

5. Python

You can get the GnuCOBOL compiler at [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnucobol).
